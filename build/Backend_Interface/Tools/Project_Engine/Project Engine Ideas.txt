Project Engine: Ideas for usage in Project. 


Considerations based on the example engine testing: 

---> The subjects of the engine must be broad enough so that a large number of input vectors can be used during the training process. 

---> The original idea was to use the marvel comics API in order to serve recommended comics based on a batching of tweets. 

    ---> This would have been done using a potential geolocator api call on the twitter api side. 


---> Some other possible API ideas: 

    ---> A news recommender system which serves news based twitter content in the region:

        ---> This can be done via the Guardian news API: 

            ---> It is possible to use tags in an API endpoint. 

            ---> The sections API can also be used in order to display content related to a section. 

            ---> The JS client can be installed via the following link: https://github.com/PorterK/GuardianJSClient



---> The main concept behind the app: 

    ---> The idea is to use a geolocator endpoint or some modified twitter endpoint, which is programmatically supplied by the UI. 

    ---> This will gather up the tweets, based on either user account tweet activity or based on a region's tweet activity. 

    ---> The tweet batch (or batches) will be fed into the NN and the softmax results will be used to serve up a top 3 hierarchy that will be displayed onto the app's UI. 

    ---> The information will be based on the either section or tag related content: 

        ---> The label categories should exist within a big 'section' such as 'business' or 'finance'.  

        ---> The actual labels should be very disinctly recognizable sub-categories for the main section?  




---> Considerations for label ideas: 

    ---> The labels should be sections in the guardian API in order to properly allow for distinct 'chunks' of vocabulary in the dictionary of the NN. 

    ---> Sections can include: 

        ---> World Affairs

        ---> Science and Technology

        ---> Business 

        ---> Football

        ---> Environment (non science).

    ---> Therefore, there will be 5 labels that will be used in a news multi-classifier recommender NN. 


---> The strategy for this will be: 

    ---> Grow a dictionary corpus of sufficient size over the course of 3-5 days. 

    ---> The dictionary shall be truncated at 1500-2000 characters. 

    ---> Then training / testing set data shall be gathered for training for 3-5 days.  

    ---> Training shall occur in order to obtain a proper weights folder (with incremental training being done as needed). 

    ---> The frontend shall then be conceptualized and developed in accordance with the recommender requirements. 

    ---> The backend shall be developed according to the frontend.
