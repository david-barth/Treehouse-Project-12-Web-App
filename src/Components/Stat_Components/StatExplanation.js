                   In this app, the neural network prediction works more accurately with at least 50 tweets.
                   If the Tweet Count is lower, the accuracy of the news prediction will suffer and it is recommended to increase the tweet data input by performing another search. 
                   This section tells you if another search is recommended by showing you the search criteria you submitted, the number of tweets currently stored, and the number of searches made previously.
                   A recommendation for data augmentation will be made if there are less than 50 tweets stored.  
                   If you wish to make this augmentation then click "Augment" in order to perform another search.  
                   In this case, it is recommended to either do a 'Glboal Search' and remove hashtags or to increase radius and change location. 
                   A search for a simlar subject is also suggested (e.g. 'President', if 'Trump' was made in the first search). 
                   If you wish to continue without performing another search, click "Read!"
