                        This app's operation is very simple: it gathers tweets off of twitter, batches them together, feeds them to a neural network, and then uses the resulting prediction to serve news topics.
                        In a way, we can call this "smart news" because the recommended news topics will change depending on the word content of the tweets fed into the neural network. 
                        The topics are: world news, science and technology, business news, soccer news, and environmental news; all articles are gathered from The Guardian. 
                        If the gathered tweet word content reflects the label 'soccer', then soccer will be the first in your recommendations and so on. 
                        Overall, machine learning allows for a flexible and adaptive approach to news recommendation.
